## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I have worked in coffee for over 8 years at this point and I have both a love for it
and an obsession with it. Coffee has a lot of information that goes with it that we need to
keep track of in order to make it taste the way we want to. My app will allow users to
create a profile where they can store said information, add more information when needed,
and be able to share that information with their friends and coworkers through social
media or email.

### Features
user login: users will be able to create accounts and profile pages for their accounts
and log in to store their information
create posts: users will be able to create new posts for their specific type of coffee and add
information to those posts
share: users will be able to share their posts with anyone via social media or email.
search: users can search for coffee from certain regions to compare their notes with other users.

### Technologies
Java
Javascript
MySQL
Bootstrap
JSP
API

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to use a public API so that users can share their information via
social media. I'll also have to learn how to use JavaScript and Bootstrap to add some style to
my website and make it look more attractive and interactive for users.
